# EDRouteManager

EDRouteManager is a simple tool for using "neutron-highways" in Elite: Dangerous that will automatically
copy the next route-system to your clipboard. 

How to use
-
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Gobidev/EDRouteManager/releases) of EDRouteManager
2. Unzip the file
3. Make sure that you are connected to your EDSM account (EDDiscovery, EDMarketConnector, etc.).
You can get to EDSM [here](https://www.edsm.net/)
4. Make sure your flight log is public (option to enter API-key will come in future updates)
5. Start EDRouteManager
6. Enter your commander-name
7. Go to https://spansh.co.uk/plotter and calculate a route
8. Download the route as csv and open it in EDRouteManager
(If you had another route open before, you might have to restart the tool)

The next neutron-star will now always be copied to your clipboard.

You can now simply open the galaxy map and paste the system into system-search.
