# EDRouteManager (DEPRECATED)

# Important
I made this program a long time ago and got much better at coding. I therefore started working on an improved version of this project called EDNeutronAssistant which can be found [here](https://github.com/Gobidev/EDNeutronAssistant).


How to use (Windows)
-
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Gobidev/EDRouteManager/releases) of EDRouteManager for Windows
2. Unzip the file
3. Make sure that you are connected to your EDSM account (EDDiscovery, EDMarketConnector, etc.).
You can get to EDSM [here](https://www.edsm.net/)
4. Make sure your flight log is public (option to enter API-key will come in future updates)
5. Start EDRouteManager.exe
6. Enter your commander-name
7. Go to https://spansh.co.uk/plotter and calculate a route
8. Download the route as csv and open it in EDRouteManager
(If you had another route open before, you might have to restart the tool)

The next neutron-star will now always be copied to your clipboard.

You can now simply open the galaxy map and paste the system into system-search.
